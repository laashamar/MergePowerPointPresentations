# **PowerPoint Presentation Merger**

A powerful Python GUI application for merging multiple PowerPoint (.pptx) files into a single presentation with perfect fidelity. Uses COM automation to ensure all formatting, animations, and embedded content are preserved during the merge process.

## **Features**

* **Modern Two-Column GUI**: Intuitive single-window interface with drag-and-drop support
* **Perfect Slide Copying**: COM automation preserves all formatting, animations, and embedded content
* **File Management**: Easy file selection with validation, reordering, and drag-and-drop capabilities
* **Smart File Validation**: Automatic detection of invalid file types, duplicates, and permission issues
* **Flexible Output**: Choose output location and filename
* **Automatic Slideshow**: Launches merged presentation immediately after creation
* **Comprehensive Logging**: Optional live logging for debugging and troubleshooting
* **Error Handling**: Robust error management with clear user feedback
* **Dual Entry Points**: Choose between standard mode or debug mode with live logging

## **System Requirements**

### **Operating System**

* **Windows 7/8/10/11** (COM automation requires Windows)

### **Software Dependencies**

## **Usage Guide**

### **Quick Start**

1. **Launch the application** using one of the methods above.
2. **Add PowerPoint files** by dragging and dropping them or using the "Browse for Files" button.
3. **Arrange the files** in the desired merge order using the up/down arrow buttons.
4. **Select output location** and enter a filename.
5. **Click "Merge Presentations"** to create your merged file.
6. **Enjoy your merged presentation** with automatic slideshow launch.

### **Detailed Workflow**

#### **Adding Files to the Merge Queue**

* **Drag and Drop**: Simply drag PowerPoint files from your file explorer and drop them into the merge queue area.
* **Browse Button**: Click "Browse for Files" to select files using a file dialog.
* **Supported Formats**: Only .pptx and .ppsx files are accepted.
* **Duplicate Prevention**: The application automatically detects and prevents duplicate file additions.
* **Permission Checking**: Files are validated for read access before being added.

#### **Managing the Merge Queue**

* **Reorder Files**: Use the ‚Üë and ‚Üì buttons on each file card to change the merge order.
* **Remove Files**: Click the ‚úï button on any file card to remove it from the queue.
* **View Full Path**: Hover over a filename to see its complete file path in a tooltip.
* **Clear Queue**: Use the "Clear Queue" button to remove all files at once.

#### **Configuring Output Settings**

* **Output Location**: Click "Browse" to select the folder where the merged file will be saved.
* **Output Filename**: Enter a name for your merged presentation (the .pptx extension is added automatically if omitted).
* **File Overwrite**: If a file with the same name exists, you'll be prompted to confirm overwriting.

#### **Merging Presentations**

* Click **"Merge Presentations"** when you're ready.
* The status label will show progress during the merge operation.
* Upon successful completion:
  * A success message displays the saved file location.
  * The merged presentation automatically opens in slideshow mode.
* If any errors occur, detailed error messages will guide you to resolve them.

## **Application Modes**

### **Standard Mode (main.py)**

* **Best for**: Regular usage and end users  
* **Features**: Clean GUI workflow without logging overhead.  
* **Command**: python main.py

### **Debug Mode (run\_with\_logging.py)**

* **Best for**: Troubleshooting and development  
* **Features**:  
  * Live logging window with real-time status updates.  
  * Detailed error reporting and diagnostics.  
  * Log file saved to Downloads/merge\_powerpoint.log.  
* **Command**: python run\_with\_logging.py

## **Testing**

### **Windows-Only Application**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This application and its test suite are designed exclusively for Windows environments. The application relies on Windows COM automation to interact with Microsoft PowerPoint, and all testing infrastructure assumes a Windows platform.

### **Running Tests Locally**

#### **Install Development Dependencies**

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

This installs:
* `pytest` - Testing framework
* `pytest-cov` - Coverage reporting
* `pre-commit` - Git hook framework

#### **Run the Test Suite**

Execute all tests from the project root directory:

```powershell
pytest
```

For detailed output with coverage report:

```powershell
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html -v
```

This generates:
* Terminal coverage report showing line-by-line coverage
* HTML coverage report in the `htmlcov/` directory (open `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser)

### **Pre-Commit Quality Checks**

The project uses the **pre-commit** framework to automatically enforce quality standards before commits are finalized.

#### **Install Pre-Commit Hooks**

```powershell
pre-commit install
```

#### **How It Works**

Every time you attempt to commit code, the pre-commit hook automatically:

1. ‚úÖ **Runs the entire test suite** using pytest
2. üîÅ **Measures code coverage** across all modules
3. üö´ **Blocks the commit** if either requirement fails:
   * **100% Test Pass Rate** - All tests must pass
   * **80% Minimum Coverage** - Total coverage must be ‚â•80%

If the requirements are not met, the commit will be rejected with a clear error message showing which tests failed or what coverage percentage was achieved.

#### **Bypass Pre-Commit Hooks (Not Recommended)**

In rare cases, you may need to commit without running hooks:

```powershell
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This should only be used in exceptional circumstances, as it bypasses quality checks.

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**

#### **GitHub Actions Workflow**

The project uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically test all code changes on a Windows environment.

#### **Workflow Triggers**

The CI pipeline runs automatically on:
* Every `push` to the `main` branch
* Every `pull_request` targeting the `main` branch

#### **Pipeline Requirements**

The workflow runs on a **Windows-latest** runner and performs:

1. Checkout code from the repository
2. Set up Python 3.12
3. Install all project dependencies
4. Run the complete test suite with coverage reporting
5. Upload HTML coverage report as a build artifact

#### **Pass/Fail Criteria**

The pipeline will **fail** if:
* ‚ùå Any test fails (100% pass rate required)
* ‚ùå Code coverage falls below 80%

#### **Viewing Results**

* **Test Results**: Visible in the GitHub Actions tab for each commit/PR
* **Coverage Report**: Download the `coverage-report` artifact from the workflow run to view detailed HTML coverage analysis

### **Test Coverage**

The test suite currently achieves **82% code coverage** across:

#### **Core Logic Tests (`test_powerpoint_core.py`)**

* ‚úÖ Successful merge of multiple PowerPoint files
* ‚úÖ Error handling for corrupt files
* ‚úÖ Error handling for missing PowerPoint installation
* ‚úÖ Error handling for save/permission errors
* ‚úÖ Edge case: merging a single file
* ‚úÖ Edge case: files with special characters and spaces
* ‚úÖ Edge case: empty file lists
* ‚úÖ Edge case: presentations with no slides

#### **GUI Logic Tests (`test_gui.py`)**

* ‚úÖ File queue management (add, remove, reorder)
* ‚úÖ File type validation (.pptx/.ppsx only)
* ‚úÖ Duplicate file prevention
* ‚úÖ Output path construction and validation
* ‚úÖ Automatic .pptx extension appending
* ‚úÖ Merge callback invocation with correct parameters
* ‚úÖ Button state management (enabled/disabled)
* ‚úÖ Empty queue and filename validation

### **Test Strategy**

* **Unit Testing**: All tests are isolated unit tests that validate individual components
* **Mocking**: External dependencies (tkinter, win32com) are mocked to enable fast, reliable tests
* **No GUI Testing**: Visual GUI testing is explicitly out of scope - tests focus on logic validation
* **Windows Platform**: All automation assumes Windows environment (no cross-platform concerns)
