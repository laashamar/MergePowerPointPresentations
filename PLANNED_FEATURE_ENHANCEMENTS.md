## **Planned Features & Enhancements**

### **ðŸŸ¡ \#1: Visual Progress Indicator During Merge**

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Open

**Priority**: High

**Complexity**: Medium

#### **Description**

Implement a progress bar or status window that displays during the merge process to provide real-time feedback to users.

#### **Technical Requirements**

* Add progress tracking to powerpoint\_core.py  
* Create progress dialog with:  
  * Progress bar showing completion percentage  
  * Current file being processed  
  * Estimated time remaining  
  * Cancel button functionality  
* Update progress after each slide or file is processed

#### **User Story**

As a user merging large presentations, I want to see the merge progress so that I know the application is working and can estimate completion time.

#### **Benefits**

* **Improved User Experience**: Users get visual confirmation that the process is active  
* **Reduced Anxiety**: No more wondering if the application has frozen  
* **Better Control**: Users can see which files are being processed  
* **Professional Feel**: Progress indicators are expected in modern applications

#### **Implementation Notes**

\# Example implementation approach  
class ProgressDialog:  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, total\_files):  
        \# Create tkinter progress window  
        pass  
      
    def update\_progress(self, current\_file, files\_completed):  
        \# Update progress bar and labels  
        pass

### **ðŸŸ¡ \#2: Enhanced Error Messages and Exception Handling**

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Open

**Priority**: High

**Complexity**: Medium

#### **Description**

Implement more specific and user-friendly error messages by catching detailed COM exceptions and providing actionable guidance.

#### **Technical Requirements**

* Extend error handling in powerpoint\_core.py to catch specific exceptions:  
  * PowerPoint not installed or not accessible  
  * File is read-only or locked  
  * File is currently open in PowerPoint  
  * Insufficient disk space  
  * File corruption or invalid format  
* Create user-friendly error dialogs with:  
  * Clear problem description  
  * Suggested solutions  
  * Links to help documentation

#### **Current vs. Improved Error Messages**

| Current | Improved |
| :---- | :---- |
| "An error occurred during merge" | "Cannot open 'presentation.pptx' \- file is currently open in PowerPoint. Please close the file and try again." |
| "Failed to merge presentations" | "Insufficient disk space to save merged presentation. Please free up 50MB and try again." |
| "COM exception" | "PowerPoint is not installed or not accessible. Please install Microsoft PowerPoint and try again." |

#### **User Story**

As a user encountering an error, I want clear information about what went wrong and how to fix it, so I can resolve the issue quickly.

#### **Benefits**

* **Reduced Support Requests**: Users can self-resolve common issues  
* **Better User Experience**: Clear guidance instead of cryptic error messages  
* **Increased Success Rate**: Users are more likely to complete their tasks  
* **Professional Quality**: Demonstrates attention to detail and user care

### **ðŸŸ¡ \#3: Cancel/Abort Functionality**

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Open

**Priority**: Medium

**Complexity**: High

#### **Description**

Add the ability to cancel operations at any point in the workflow, with safe cleanup of resources and COM objects.

#### **Technical Requirements**

* Add "Cancel" buttons to all workflow windows:  
  * File selection dialog  
  * File reordering window  
  * Merge progress dialog  
* Implement safe abort mechanism:  
  * Stop current COM operations  
  * Close all open PowerPoint objects  
  * Clean up temporary files  
  * Prevent orphaned PowerPoint processes  
* Add confirmation dialog for cancellation during merge

#### **Technical Challenges**

* **COM Object Cleanup**: Ensuring proper disposal of PowerPoint objects  
* **Thread Safety**: Managing cancellation across different threads  
* **State Management**: Properly resetting application state after cancellation

#### **User Story**

As a user who realizes I've made a mistake or needs to stop the process, I want to cancel the operation safely without having to force-quit the application.

#### **Benefits**

* **User Control**: Users can exit gracefully from any point  
* **System Stability**: Prevents orphaned processes and resource leaks  
* **Error Recovery**: Allows users to start over after mistakes  
* **Professional Behavior**: Expected functionality in modern applications

### **ðŸ”µ \#4: Consistent Application Icon**

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Open

**Priority**: Low

**Complexity**: Low

#### **Description**

Apply the existing application icon (resources/MergePowerPoint.ico) consistently across all windows.

#### **Technical Requirements**

* Configure icon for compiled executable in build process  
* Ensure icon displays correctly in:  
  * All GUI windows  
  * Windows taskbar  
  * Alt+Tab application switcher  
  * Desktop shortcuts

#### **Implementation**

\# In gui.py \- add to all window creation functions  
icon\_path \= os.path.join("resources", "MergePowerPoint.ico")  
if os.path.exists(icon\_path):  
    window.iconbitmap(icon\_path)

#### **User Story**

As a user, I want the application to have a consistent, professional appearance with a recognizable icon across all windows.

#### **Benefits**
