Instructions to Refactor and Fix the PowerPoint Merger ScriptObjectiveYour task is to refactor and fix the Python script merge_presentations.py. The current script fails due to unreliable libraries and incorrect assumptions about the execution environment. You will replace faulty components with robust alternatives and restructure the code for better modularity.1. Fix the GUI (Remove tkinterdnd2)The tkinterdnd2 library is causing the drag-and-drop functionality to fail. Replace it with standard tkinter widgets.Remove Dependency: Uninstall tkinterdnd2 and remove its import statement from the script. Replace all instances of TkinterDnD.Tk() with the standard tk.Tk().File Selection Window (show_file_selection_window):Remove the drag-and-drop functionality entirely. The user will select files only via the "Add Files from Disk" button.File Reordering Window (show_reorder_window):Replace the drag-and-drop listbox with a standard tk.Listbox.Add two buttons below the listbox: "Move Up" and "Move Down".Implement the logic for these buttons to modify the order of the files in the list when an item is selected and a button is clicked.2. Fix the Merging Logic (Replace python-pptx with pywin32)The core merging logic fails because python-pptx cannot correctly copy slide content. You must replace this with COM automation to control the PowerPoint application directly.Add Dependency: The script will now require the pywin32 library. Add it to requirements.txt.Rewrite the Merging Function (merge_and_launch):Use the win32com.client module to instantiate the PowerPoint application (PowerPoint.Application).Create a new presentation using the COM object.For each source file path in the specified order:Open the source presentation using the COM object.Iterate through the slides of the source presentation.For each slide, use PowerPoint's native Copy() and Paste() methods to transfer it to the destination presentation. This will ensure a perfect copy of all content, formatting, and animations.Close the source presentation without saving changes.After all slides are copied, save the new presentation with the user-provided filename.3. Fix the Slideshow LaunchThe subprocess call to powerpnt.exe fails because the executable is not in the system's PATH. Use the existing COM object for a more reliable launch.Implement COM-based Launch: After saving the merged presentation, use the COM presentation object to start the slideshow directly. The method to call is presentation.SlideShowSettings.Run().Ensure the PowerPoint application instance is properly closed and released (Application.Quit()) after the process is complete.4. Refactor the Code into ModulesThe entire logic is currently in a single class within one file. Refactor this into a modular structure where each module has a single responsibility.Create a main.py file: This file should be the entry point of the application. Its only purpose is to import and call the function that starts the application.Create a core module (e.g., core.py):This module will contain the business logic for merging presentations using pywin32. The refactored merge_and_launch function should reside here.Create a gui module (e.g., gui.py):This module will contain all the code related to building and managing the tkinter GUI windows. The functions for showing the different steps (show_number_of_files_window, show_file_selection_window, etc.) should be here.Create an app module (e.g., app.py):This module will contain the main application class or logic that orchestrates the workflow, connecting the GUI events from the gui module with the backend logic in the core module. It will manage the application state (selected files, order, output name). Check all non .py files are up to date. If not updated rewrite files (like README.md). The main.py will call a function from this module to run the app.Ensure all code follows PEP 8 styling guidelines.
