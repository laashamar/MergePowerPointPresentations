* Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code

### **Package Structure**

* All new Python modules should be added to `src/merge_powerpoint/`
* Follow the established package structure with proper imports
* Update `__init__.py` exports when adding new public APIs
* Maintain backward compatibility with root-level compatibility shims if needed

### **Code Quality Tools**

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all quality checks:
