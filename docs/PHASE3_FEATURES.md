# Phase 3 Features Documentation

This document describes the new features implemented in Phase 3 of the PowerPoint Merger application.

## Overview

Phase 3 introduces advanced user interface features that significantly enhance the user experience:
- Drag-and-drop file addition
- Drag-and-drop list reordering
- Real-time merge progress feedback
- Post-merge action buttons

All features are implemented following PEP8 coding standards and include comprehensive logging.

## 1. Drag-and-Drop File Addition

### Description
Users can now add PowerPoint files by dragging them from their file explorer directly onto the application window.

### How It Works
- Drag one or more `.pptx` files from Windows Explorer, Finder, or your file manager
- Drop them anywhere on the "Selected Presentations" list area
- Valid `.pptx` files are automatically added to the merge list
- Non-`.pptx` files are silently ignored

### Technical Implementation
- Uses `tkinterdnd2` library for cross-platform drag-and-drop support
- File validation: `os.path.splitext(file)[1].lower() == '.pptx'`
- Duplicate files are automatically prevented
- All operations are logged for debugging

### Code Location
- Method: `App._setup_drag_and_drop()` in `new_gui/main_gui.py`
- Drop handler: `App._on_drop(event)`
- File parser: `App._parse_drop_files(data)`

## 2. Drag-and-Drop List Reordering

### Description
The order of files in the merge list can be changed by clicking and dragging file labels to new positions.

### How It Works
1. Click on any file name in the list
2. Hold the mouse button and drag to a new position
3. Release the mouse button to drop the file in its new position
4. The file list is automatically updated with the new order

### Visual Feedback
- Each file is numbered (1, 2, 3, etc.) to show the current merge order
- Files are displayed in individual frames for better visual separation

### Technical Implementation
- Mouse event bindings: `<Button-1>`, `<B1-Motion>`, `<ButtonRelease-1>`
- Selected file index is tracked during drag operation
- Order changes are immediately reflected in `self.file_list`
- All reordering operations are logged

### Code Location
- Click handler: `App._on_label_click(index)`
- Drag handler: `App._on_label_drag(event)`
- Release handler: `App._on_label_release(event)`

## 3. Dynamic Status Feedback During Merge

### Description
The merge process now provides real-time feedback about which file and slide is being processed, keeping users informed without blocking the GUI.

### Status Messages
- **Starting**: "Starting merge..."
- **In Progress**: "Merging \"[filename]\" (slide X of Y)..."
- **Success**: "Merge Complete!"
- **Error**: "Error: [specific error message]"

### How It Works
1. When "Merge Presentations" is clicked, the merge runs in a separate thread
2. The GUI remains responsive during the entire merge process
3. Progress callbacks update the status label in real-time
4. Upon completion, post-merge action buttons become visible

### Technical Implementation
- Threading: Merge runs in separate thread via `threading.Thread`
- Progress callback: `powerpoint_core.merge_presentations()` accepts callback parameter
- Thread-safe updates: Uses `self.after(0, lambda: ...)` to update GUI from worker thread
- Non-blocking: Main GUI thread remains responsive for user interaction

### Code Location
- Main merge method: `App.merge_presentations()`
- Thread worker: `App._perform_merge_thread(file_list, output_path)`
- Progress callback: `App._merge_progress_callback(filename, current_slide, total_slides)`
- Safe update: `App._update_status_safe(text)`

### Modified Core Logic
- Function: `powerpoint_core.merge_presentations(file_order, output_filename, progress_callback=None)`
- The callback is invoked for each slide during processing
- Backward compatible: callback is optional (default=None)

## 4. Post-Merge Actions

### Description
After a successful merge, two action buttons appear to provide quick access to the merged file.

### Buttons

#### Open Presentation
- Opens the merged `.pptx` file in the system's default PowerPoint application
- Cross-platform support:
  - **Windows**: Uses `os.startfile()`
  - **macOS**: Uses `subprocess.run(["open", path])`
  - **Linux**: Uses `subprocess.run(["xdg-open", path])`

#### Show in Explorer
- Opens the file explorer and highlights the merged file
- Cross-platform support:
  - **Windows**: Uses `subprocess.run(['explorer', '/select,', path])`
  - **macOS**: Uses `subprocess.run(['open', '-R', path])`
  - **Linux**: Opens containing directory with `subprocess.run(['xdg-open', directory])`

### Button Visibility
- Hidden by default (not packed into layout)
- Automatically shown after successful merge completion
- Hidden again when starting a new merge

### Technical Implementation
- Buttons are created in `__init__` but not packed
- Method `_show_post_merge_buttons()` makes them visible via `self.after()`
- Last merged file path stored in `self.last_merged_file_path`
- Error handling for all system operations

### Code Location
- Button creation: In `App.__init__()`
- Show buttons: `App._show_post_merge_buttons()`
- Open file: `App.open_merged_file()`
- Show in explorer: `App.show_in_file_explorer()`

## Code Quality

All Phase 3 code follows these standards:

### PEP8 Compliance
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Proper indentation and spacing
- No trailing whitespace
- Verified with `pycodestyle`

### PEP257 Docstrings
- All functions and methods include docstrings
- Google-style format with Args, Returns sections where applicable
- Clear, concise descriptions of functionality

### Logging
- All significant operations are logged using the `logging` module
- Log levels: INFO for normal operations, ERROR for failures, WARNING for edge cases
- Includes file names, slide counts, and error details

## Dependencies

### New Requirement
- `tkinterdnd2>=0.3.0` - Cross-platform drag-and-drop support for Tkinter

### Installation
```bash
pip install tkinterdnd2>=0.3.0
```

Or install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Backward Compatibility

All Phase 3 features are designed to be backward compatible:
- Existing file selection methods (Add Presentation button) still work
- The `powerpoint_core.merge_presentations()` function remains backward compatible
  - The `progress_callback` parameter is optional
  - Existing code calling without callback will continue to work
- All existing functionality is preserved

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future phases:
- Visual drag indicator during reordering
- Undo/redo for file list changes
- Progress bar in addition to text status
- Batch processing of multiple merge jobs
- Save/load merge configurations
